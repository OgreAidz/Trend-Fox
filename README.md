# Trend-Fox
This repository will contain the source code for a read-only application that accesses Reddit’s Data API using OAuth to retrieve public subreddit posts.

The application will make authenticated requests to subreddit listing endpoints (e.g. /r/{subreddit}/new) to read post metadata and public text fields for aggregate analysis.

No posting, messaging, or user interaction will be performed. The repository currently contains no API code pending approval.
